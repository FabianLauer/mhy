# tsc

- Environment: `development`
- By default `tsc` is only used for type-checking and to generate `.d.ts` files. Compilation is done by `babel`.
- Inside `ui` the `-w` flag is being added to the command to automatically watch for changes.

> A `tsconfig.json` is required for you to have at your project's root folder. `mhy` will create one if it doesn't exists yet.

## Default command
```bash
tsc --project ./tsconfig.json
```

## CLI Options

## Examples

### Default CLI
```bash
mhy tsc
```

### With watcher
```bash
mhy tsc -w
```
