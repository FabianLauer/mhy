# boot

description: This tool will let you initialize codebase from a template.

## Templates

Currently `boot` has a simple `default` template available, but we're looking forward on having more templates available in the long run.

### React Default Template

The current `default` template is a React project and it contains the following structure:

* `components`: components directory
* `config`: app configuration directory
* `core`: app mounting, routing and flux store directory
* `entities`: HTTP code related directory
* `fields`: app specific form fields directory
* `forms`: app specific forms and business logic directory
* `layouts`: is a container for a page to represent different

  states of an application

* `overlays`: basically containers to construct a overlay's structure.
* `pages`: basically containers to construct a page's structure.
* `services`: a base service implementation which you build your APIs

  on.

* `validators`: custom validator function usually for `react-redux-form`
* `index.js`: files are being used to export sub-modules for

  easier/simplier/nicer imports.

## How to use it

```bash
mhy boot [technology:react|vue|...] [template:default|...] [-o,--output: output path]
```

* `technology`: what tech should be used.
  * `default`: react
* `template`: what template should be loaded.
  * `default`: default
* `-o, --output`: path where the template should be booted.
  * `default`: src

Examples:

```bash
mhy boot react default -o src
# or
mhy boot
# or
mhy boot react
# or
mhy boot -o xproject/path/src
```
