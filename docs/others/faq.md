# FAQ

## Why `mhy`?
My original plan was to make a simple tool that can run all MY(!) processes at once. Then the project grew. The first idea was to run the tool using `my dev`. But the name (_my_) was taken on NPM. Then I checked `mhy` which was free, H is a silent sound when you pronounce it and also finding a 3 letter name is kinda a hidden gem, so I took it. It's important to be short because you'll end up typing the command many times so it's more comfortable.

## Are there any upcoming features?

You can always follow our continuous TODO list here: [https://github.com/wintercounter/mhy/issues/1](https://github.com/wintercounter/mhy/issues/1)

## Why no more question?

I have more important things to do now :\)
